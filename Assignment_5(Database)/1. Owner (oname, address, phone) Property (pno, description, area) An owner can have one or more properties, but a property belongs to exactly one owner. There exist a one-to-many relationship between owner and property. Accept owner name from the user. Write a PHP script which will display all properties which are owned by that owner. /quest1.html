1. Owner (oname, address, phone)
Property (pno, description, area)
An owner can have one or more properties, but a property belongs to exactly one owner.
There exist a one-to-many relationship between owner and property.
Accept owner name from the user. Write a PHP script which will display all properties which are
owned by that owner.
